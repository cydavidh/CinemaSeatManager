CinemaSeatManager is a Spring Boot application designed for managing cinema seat bookings. 

Functionalities include seat reservation, ticket returns, and theatre statistics through RESTful endpoints.

Basically showcases the integration of Spring Boot with business logic for cinema operations. 

I addressed the multithreading concerns by ensuring thread-safe operations for concurrent seat booking activities, enhancing data integrity in scenarios of simultaneous access.

I also added custom exception handling and Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) to ensure efficient data handling and client-server communication.

The application includes JUnit tests to verify functionalities such as seat bookings, ticket returns, and theatre statistics, ensuring its reliability.
