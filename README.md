CinemaSeatManager is a Spring Boot application for managing cinema seat bookings. 

It features seat reservation, ticket returns, and theatre statistics through RESTful endpoints.

This project demonstrates integrating Spring Boot with business logic for cinema operations and incorporates custom exception handling and data transfer objects (DTOs) to ensure efficient data handling and client-server communication.
